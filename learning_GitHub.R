# Learning github, markdown etc notes 


# Github ------------------------------------------------------------------


# Github is a useful tool for sharing and collaborating on projects with others
# It can also be used for archiving your own work so you can return to 
# your work at a previous state.

# If someone else has a code repository you want to use, you can create
# your own fork of the repo or use it as a template 
# Step 1: go to "newblog" repository and create forked copy or create template 
# (which is a completely independent copy, creates new repository but has 
# all the same files)
# step 2: you now have copy of files, click on clone or download button, copy URL
# Step 3: Go to rstudio and create 'new project from Git Repo, paste URL
# Think about: what has come across? Just the files, none of the packages etc



# markdown ----------------------------------------------------------------

# 'serve_site()' - allows you to see the site 
# markdown doesnt specify style 
# need to use different styles to get fonts and different bullet points etc
