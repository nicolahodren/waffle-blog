I am learning to use markdown. Here are a few things I have learnt so far:

## Using bullet points

- Bullet points
1. Numbered points
- Images
- Inserting URL
- Writing equations

### Insert image

![](https://placekitten.com/400/400)

### To insert URL
Inserting URL: https://placekitten.com

To make a named link: [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com)

## To write an equation 
$$
1 + 5 = 7
$$
note: It does not have to be correct
